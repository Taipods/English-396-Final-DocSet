  ### What Is MyFavoriteAlbum?
  MyFavoriteAlbum is an upcoming website that tracks the top album, band, and single for every year

  check if a band had a number one album, compare bands, and check a personal vinyl collection of the
  creator. The website allows you to add on more analysis through the use of R. It’s a open source
  project that allows interested beginning R devs to learn more about R and added on to a cool website.

# Prerequisites
While you don't need to be an expert coder, it's helpful if you have some experience with programming—especially if you've dabbled in languages like Python for data analysis to add your own analysis. MyFavoriteAlbum site is built using the basics of R, along with some helpful libraries like Shiny (for web apps), dplyr (for data manipulation), and ggplot2 (for creating beautiful graphics). However, if you want to look at your data info, it's not necessary to have coding experience at all.
