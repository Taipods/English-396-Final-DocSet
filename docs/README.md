  ### What Is MyFavoriteAlbum?

      MyFavoriteAlbum is an upcoming website that tracks the top album, band, and single for every year
      from 1993 to 2024. Users can use the website to check the number one album of a particular year,
      check if a band had a number one album, compare bands, and check a personal vinyl collection of the
      creator. The website allows you to add on more analysis through the use of R. Itâ€™s a open source
      project that allows interested beginning R devs to learn more about R and added on to a cool website.
